Libraries Used
React Redux to keep track of the state.
rn-fetch-blob for downloading and saving images to the phone. Downloaded images can be found inside the photos, under library tab.
react-native-vector-icons/FontAwesome for all my icons.

Choices made:
I have choseen to use container/view pattern because i wanted to separate views from logic. This pattern helps when it comes to code re-use and also makes testing very simple. modules are very independent from each other.

Notes
This app was only tested in Android device/platform
